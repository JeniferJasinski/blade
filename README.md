## Welcome to my new blog

Since I bought my first own PC, I had problems deciding which kind of PC it should be. In recent years, this problem grew even stronger. Thanks to slim keybords and battery packs, completly new kinds of PCs (like so called convertibles) appeared and made it much harder to decide, which kind of PC is the most suitable for every situation. In my view, there are about different kinds of PCs:

- Desktops (The well known "big boxes", which are connected to the monitor, they were the first kind of PCs, which was created)
- MiniPCs (Quite similar to a desktop, but much smaller and less powerfull, normally placed on the table instead of beneath, often used in offices)
- TowerPCs (Just the opposite of the miniPC, big and powerfull, normally used by gamers and different kinds of creatives, such es video editors)
- "Normal" laptops (A slim combination of screen, computer and keybord with a battery pack, used by all people, who need to travel with their PC)
- Ultrabooks (extremly thin laptops with a very long battery life, constructed for beeing lightweight and independent from an office, but often they are not very powerful)
-Desktop Replacements (pretty huge laptops with more or the same computing power, but sadly, they are mostly bold and don't have long battery life)
- Convertibles (Very slim laptops, which can be _converted_ into a tablet in one way or another, therefore the name)
